## Lab Environment Overview

### Network Architecture
The lab implements a three-tier security model with distinct trust zones:

| Zone | VLAN | Network | Trust Level | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Admin | 10 | 192.168.10.0/24 | High | Network management and monitoring |
| User | 20 | 192.168.20.0/24 | Medium | General user workstations |
| DMZ | 30 | 192.168.30.0/24 | Low | Public-facing services |

### Security Controls Implemented
1. **Network Segmentation**: VLANs with router-on-a-stick configuration
2. **Perimeter Defense**: pfSense firewall with Snort IDS integration
3. **Access Control**: Layer 3 ACLs and stateful firewall rules
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and traffic analysis

## Security Testing Results

### 1. Brute Force Attack Simulation

#### Test Scenario
- **Attack Vector**: SSH brute force against DMZ server (192.168.30.10)
- **Source**: External attacker (203.0.113.50)
- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Attack Rate**: 3-4 attempts per second

#### Results
```
Detection Time: 12 seconds (after 5th failed attempt)
Blocking Time: 28 seconds (after 10th failed attempt)
Total Attempts: 247 login attempts
Usernames Tried: admin, root, user, administrator, guest
Passwords Tried: password, 123456, admin, root, qwerty, welcome
```

#### Security Controls Performance

nmap -sS 192.168.10.100   # Port scan admin server
nmap -sS 192.168.30.0/24  # DMZ network scan

# Connection attempts
ssh admin@192.168.10.100  # Admin server access
telnet 192.168.30.10 23   # DMZ server access
rdp 192.168.10.50 3389    # Admin workstation access
```
